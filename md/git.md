```

Set up git credentials

```bash

```

```bash
git config user.name "SomeName"
```

---

## Start

Initialize new project

```bash
git init
```

Clone project

```bash
git clone https://...
```

Add remote origin

```bash
git remote origin https://...
```

---

## Branches

Get all the branches

```bash
git fetch
```

Get all the repo's branches

```bash
git branch -a
```

Check all the branches

```bash
git branch
```

Create new branch

```bash
git branch branch-name-here
```

Create new branch and switch to it

```bash
git checkout -b branch-name-here
```

Delete local branch

```bash
git branch -d branch-name-here
```

Rename branch name

```bash
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

Switch to a branch

```bash
git checkout branch-name-here
```

Get changes from the remote origin to the current branch

```bash
git pull origin branch-name-here
```

---

## Workflow

Check the status of the current branch changes

```bash
git status
```

Stage all the current branch changes

```bash
git add .
```

Commit all the current branch changes

```bash
git commit -m 'some: message'
```

Publish all the commited current branch changes to the remote origin

```bash
git push origin branch-name-here
```

Checkout to develop branch and update it after merge feature branch

```bash
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
```

---

## Tips

Hide uncommited changes of the current branch

```bash
git stash
```

Get back hidden uncommited changes of the current branch

```bash
git stash pop
```

Cancel uncommited changes of the current branch

```bash
git restore file-name-here
```

```bash
git restore .
```

Cancel last local commit of the current branch

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

## Commits

Commits history

```bash
git log
```

Restore file of the current branch from stages status

```bash
git reset HEAD file-name-here
```

Cancel last local commit of the current branch

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

Get working flow and index of git to last commit state:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

Roll back commit by commit hash from the log

```bash
git revert commit-hash-here
```

### What the difference between git reset and git revert?

The **git reset** and **git revert** commands in Git are both used to undo changes in a repository, but they work in different ways.

**git reset**: This command is used to reset the current branch to a specific commit. It can be used to move the HEAD and the current branch pointer to a different commit, effectively "rewinding" the history of the branch. There are different modes of git reset such as --soft, --mixed, and --hard, which determine whether the changes made after the specified commit are kept, staged, or discarded.

This command will move the HEAD and the current branch pointer three commits back, discarding any changes made after that point.

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~3
```

**git revert**: This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in a specific commit. It does not modify the existing commit history; instead, it creates a new commit that represents the inverse of the specified commit. This is useful when you want to keep a record of the fact that a particular commit was undone.

This command will create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the most recent commit

```bash
git revert HEAD
```

In summary, **git reset** is used to move the current branch to a different point in history, potentially discarding changes, while **git revert** is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a specific commit without altering the existing commit history.

## Using rebase

```bash
git pull origin <dev-branch-name>
```

```bash
git checkout <local-branch>
```

```bash
git rebase develop
```

```bash
git push â€”force-with-lease origin <local-branch>
```
